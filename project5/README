Project Description
===================

Project 5 involves writing a client for a server that checks to see if it is
receiving well-formatted UDP/IPv4 packets. The goal is to send a total of 12
packets, each double the size of the last. Data size will start at 2 bytes.
The contents of the data section must be random. The destination port number is
received from the server after sending an initial IPv4 packet (sans-UDP) with
0xDEADBEEF in the data section.

The UDP segment structure is given below (taken from RFC768).

0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31  
+--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
|     Source      |   Destination   | 
|      Port       |      Port       | 
+--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
|                 |                 | 
|     Length      |    Checksum     |

Building
========

Just run `make`, and the binaries will be placed into a local bin/ folder. To
disable optimizations and enable debugging symbols, use the 'all-debug' target
like so: `make all-debug`.
