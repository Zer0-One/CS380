Project Description
===================

Project 2 involves writing a very simple client for a chat server that the
professor has written. The first line you send is interpreted as a username.
Every line that you send after the first is sent to every use connected to the
server.

Building
========

Just run `make`, and the binaries will be placed into a local bin/ folder. To
disable optimization and enable debugging symbols, use the 'all-debug' target
like so: `make all-debug`.
